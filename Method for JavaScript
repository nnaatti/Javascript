-> Method -> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.
	Example- Accessing Object Methods
			You will typically describe fullName() as a method of the person object, and fullName as a property.

The fullName property will execute (as a function) when it is invoked with ().

This example accesses the fullName() method of a person object:
		name = person.fullName();
