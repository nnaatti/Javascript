-> Concept-> JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.
-> Variable -> In JavaScript, a variable can be declared using var, let, const keywords.

var keyword is used to declare variables since JavaScript was created. It is confusing and error-prone when using variables declared using var.
let keyword removes the confusion and error of var. It is the new and recommended way of declaring variables in JavaScript.
const keyword is used to declare a constant variable that cannot be changed once assigned a value.
	Example -> let msg ;
			msg = "Hello world"; //assigned string value

		-> let name = "Natnael"; //assigned string value

		-> let num = 50; //assigned numeric value

		-> let isActive = true; //assigned boolean value

-> Datatype ->  String = Textual data
		Number = Numeric
		BigInt = an integer with arbitrary precision
		Boolean = Any of two values: True or False 
		undefined = a data type whose variable is not initialized
		null = denotes a null value
		Symbol = datatype whose instances are unique and immutable
		Object = Key-value
